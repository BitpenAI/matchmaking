# Key Components of a Matching Algorithm
### User Profiles:
Collect data such as gender, age, location, interests, and other user-defined preferences.
Use profile pictures and a brief bio for additional user insights.

### User Preferences:
Allow users to specify preferences, like age range, distance radius, and interests.
Consider how users swipe (like/dislike) to adjust their preferences dynamically.

### Behavioral Analysis:
Track user activity, like swipe patterns and message engagement.
Leverage machine learning to predict user preferences based on these patterns.

### Location-Based Filtering:
Use geolocation data to prioritize matches within a certain distance.
Update dynamically as users move.

### Mutual Interest Model:
Both users must express interest (e.g., both swipe right) for a match to be established.
In Bumble’s case, women must initiate the conversation, adding a layer of interaction.

### Scoring System:
Implement a scoring mechanism to rank potential matches based on compatibility and relevance.
Adjust scores over time using algorithms like collaborative filtering, which can suggest matches based on similar user behaviors.

## Boost & Superlike Features:
Include premium features to increase the visibility of a user’s profile.
These can affect the algorithm by temporarily boosting a profile's visibility.
